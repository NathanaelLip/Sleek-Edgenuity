# Sleek-Edgenuity
Made to make Edgenuity look more modern, and stop hurting my eyes.

Hello! My name is Nathanael, and I created Sleek Edgenuity in 2023 for my enjoyment. I then released it onto UserStyles.world, and since then I updated it to also include the homepage of Edgenuity.

# Download Instructions
Download any user styles extension, my recommendation is [Stylus](https://add0n.com/stylus.html) as it is available on both [Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne) and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/). If you prefer another please use that.

Then either copy the code from the css file in the repository, or go to [Sleek Edgenuity on userstyles.world](https://userstyles.world/style/12518/sleek-edgenuity) and click install. Then click install again and you should be good to go! Enjoy your new sleek Edgenuity.
